# LC3-VirtualMachine

## Author: Federico Giacardi, following [Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton's tutorial](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/)

# Description
The goal of this project is to develop a virtual machine, written in C language, that implementes the LC-3 architecture.
I decided to complete this project to brush up on what I have learnt about computer architectures, CPUs and assembly languages during the first of my bachelor CS degree.

# Instructions
In order to use this virtual machine you must:
    1. Compile the source code with your favourite compiler
    2. Download the object file of the LC-3 assembly program you want to execute
    3. Place the object file mentioned above in the same directory of the virtual machine executable for a simpler usage
    4. Launch the virtual machine using the syntax: [Executable name] [LC-3 Source file 1] [LC-3 Source file 2] ...
